Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance
Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to automate anomaly detection for predictive maintenance in industrial machinery. 
By identifying anomalies in sensor data, the system aims to predict potential machine failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.
